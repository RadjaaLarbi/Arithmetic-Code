# Arithmetic-Coding

Arithmetic coding is a data compression technique that encodes data

This repository contains both Encoding and Decoding code both followed by their "main.cpp"
Each function has its own program so they must be executed separatly 

I created this program in 64-bit architecture

in order to avoid any type of warnings 
Both programs must be compiled in "Code Blocks" or an online compiler (not on Visual Studio Code)

This program requires the basics only (minimum requirement) 
Just "iostream" library 
and it was made as home work using the algorithm given to us in class .
